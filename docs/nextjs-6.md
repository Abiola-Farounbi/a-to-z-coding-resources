## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a full-stack framework for modern apps created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that enables functionality such as server-side rendering(SSR) and static site generation(SSG).

Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client, Next.js allows the first-page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO & performance.

## Its benefits

- easy page routing
- out-of-the-box Typescript
- easy deployment
- relatively easy to learn after learning React.js
- built-in CSS support
- multiple data fetching
- file system routing
- code splitting and bundling

## Where to learn Next.js

So, if you are curious about Next.js, I have compiled free resources for you, don't think that if it's free, it is not so good or something, the resources are beginner-friendly and taught by very professional developers like [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock), [Cassidy Williams from Netlify](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), [Lee Robinson from Vercel](https://twitter.com/leeerob); if you would like to learn more you can purchase a Udemy course, I saw that [Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/#instructor-1) just released the latest Next.js course, you can check it out.
