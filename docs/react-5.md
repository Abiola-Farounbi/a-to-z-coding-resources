## Wrapping Up

I hope you liked this post, I didn't include so many resources because Github Repos already are so detailed, I would suggest you review the resources there.

My favorite React paid course is [Master React with Redux 2020 Update](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) from Stephen Grider. It is an excellent course, you will learn everything in detail, almost half of the course is deprecated but Stephen updated the course with new materials.

## ðŸ’¥ Ready - Set - Go ðŸ’¥

So, if you are new to React.js, you can start learning from these resources, I think it's a good way to spend your Sunday.
