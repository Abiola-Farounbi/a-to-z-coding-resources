## **How to create a Pull Request for A-Z Coding Resources**

### Adding a New Resource

- Go to the `docs` folder and look at the resources.
- All you need is adding a unique new resource to any of the markdown files. You only need to add one resource for the Pull Request.
- Go to the end of the page and add a new resource.
- Image of the resource is not necessary, if you want to add the image of the website, you can first load the image on Dev.to and paste the link from there.
- You can add a short description after the heading. For the heading use `###` for Heading level 3 and make sure it looks good.

If you need help writing markdown files, you can checkout [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

## Creating A New Resource Page and Adding New Resource

If you cannot find a new resource to add, you can just create a new page and a different category. It can be related to frontend, backend, cloud, blockchain, or mobile development. It can be whatever you want.

For that, create a new markdown file for a new category and add the resource there.

- create the file name as `<category>-<number>.md` and add the resource to the file. For example, you can the file as `free-websites-1.md`. Then, go to `sidebars.js` file in the root of the project and add the file name to the list.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  someSidebar: {
    resources: [
      'free-websites-1',
      'free-media-3',
      'react-5',
      'css-2',
      // 'markdown-features',
      'javascript-4',
      'nextjs-6',
      'job-hunt-8',
      'career-9',
      'computer-science-7',
      // add the new file name
    ],
  },
}
```

- MDX file starts with [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/03-front-matter/) block declared as triple-dashed lines. Declare the `title` property.

```md
---
title: Free Images/Videos
---
```

- After the title, add your resource similar to this:

```md

## Review Your Changes\*\*

Use the `git diff` command to see the changes youâ€™ve made. This will show your changes with the + sign. To quit the terminal, use the q key.

Run the project.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure the page loads without any errors and you have added a new resource.

## Stage, Commit and Push Your Changes\*\*

Next, you want to stage, commit, and push your changes to your fork. Staging means saving your changes so they are ready to be added to your branch.

```
git add .
git commit -m "type your commit message"
```

- m is a flag for the message. That means that whatever comes after -m is a message explaining your commit. Your commit message doesn't have any effect on your code; it's like a comment.

```
git push
```

`git push` adds the changes on your computer to your GitHub repository.

## Create a Pull Request

Navigate back to the original repo from which you forked, and you will see a prompt to open a new Pull Request from the branch you just pushed to.

Click **Compare & pull request**, add a description describing the changes you made.

To submit your pull request, click the green **'Create pull request'** button.

Well done, you have made your first pull request! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
